Umbrella – Macro Utility for Dota

Umbrella is a lightweight macro utility designed to streamline repetitive in-game inputs and improve workflow efficiency for players of Dota 2. The goal of the project is to provide a clean, minimal, and performance-friendly assistant that focuses on input automation without modifying game files or interacting with protected memory.

Umbrella works as an external macro tool. It operates at the input level only, meaning it simulates standard keyboard and mouse actions in a controlled and user-configurable way. The application does not inject into the game process and does not alter gameplay data. It is built with stability and safety in mind, ensuring compatibility with standard system environments.


# ✨ Features

- Configurable keybind presets

- Customizable delay and timing settings

- Lightweight background operation

- Simple and intuitive interface

- Profile saving and loading (JSON-based)

- Low system resource usage

- Umbrella allows users to create and manage multiple macro profiles for different heroes or playstyles. Each profile can be adjusted to match personal timing preferences. The interface is designed to be minimal and distraction-free, making setup fast and straightforward.

- The project focuses on efficiency and accessibility rather than complexity. It avoids unnecessary overlays or intrusive UI elements and keeps system impact low.


# 🖥 System Requirements

Umbrella is designed to run smoothly on most modern systems.

Minimum requirements:

- OS: Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)

- RAM: 2 GB+

- CPU: Dual-core processor 2.0 GHz+

- Storage: 100 MB free space

- .NET Runtime (latest stable version recommended)

Recommended:

- 4 GB RAM or more

- SSD storage

- Modern multi-core CPU

- Because the tool runs externally and does not rely on heavy graphical components, it remains responsive even on entry-level hardware.

# 🔒 Design Philosophy

Umbrella is built around three core principles:

1. Performance – Minimal CPU and memory footprint.

2. Simplicity – Clean UI, fast configuration.

3. Compatibility – No file modifications or internal process interaction.

The project is intended for educational and productivity purposes, focusing on automation logic and user interface design. All automation operates strictly through standard input simulation.
